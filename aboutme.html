<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> Hi! I am a researcher broadly working on problems at the intersection of Information Theory and Optimization. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be part of a profession that allows me to constantly learn, innovate, and uncover mysteries for a living. Currently, I am employed as a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg" target= "blank"> National University of Singapore</a>. I am hosted by <a href ="https://vyftan.github.io/" target="_blank" > Prof. Vincent Tan </a>  and <a href ="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/" target="_blank" > Prof. Jonathan  Scarlett</a>.</p> 


<p>I received my Ph.D. degree from the <a  href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in" target="_blank"> Department of Electrical Communication Engineering</a>, <a  href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Science, </a> Bangalore, India, where I was advised by <a  href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~htyagi/" target="_blank">Prof. Himanshu Tyagi</a>. I  got my Masters's degree from the <a  href="http://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department, IIT Bombay,</a> Mumbai, India, and my Bachelor's degree from the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, <a  href="http:https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce"> K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering,</a> Mumbai, India.</p>
 
   <p>Before joining NUS, I was  a research scientist at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="blank"> Huwaei RnD,</a> Bangalore. At Huawei, I  worked broadly on online prediction problems in computational advertising. In the past, I have also held research positions at the Indian Urban Data Exchange and the TCS Innovation Labs. </p>

<p> My research interests lie at the intersection of information theory and stochastic optimization. My recent research includes developing communication-efficient algorithms for federated learning and understanding the bottlenecks imposed on federated learning due to information constraints such as limited communication, computation, and privacy.  I have also worked on entropic compression for timely information updates. In the past, I have used discrete event system simulation and mathematical programming for academic research and industrial projects. </p>

<p>My Ph.D. thesis was a runner for the IKDD Best Doctoral Dissertation in Data Science Award, 2022. For my work on entropic compression for timely updates, I was awarded the best student paper award at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, 2018. I was also a recipient of the Wipro Ph.D. Fellowship and a finalist for the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship, 2018. </p>
